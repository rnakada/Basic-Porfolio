                        <p>My name is Ryuichi, I like to go by the name Ry. I am 27 years old and my birthday is on December 24th. My ethnic background is korean and japanese. When I was 19, I decided to take my career to the automotive field. Attending Lincoln Technical Institute for 13 months, I finally graduated and started my career working in a independent shop. I currently have almost 9 years of experience on various make and model vehicles. I am currently still in the automotive field, but I believe it is time to start a new chapter in my life, and thats to enter the field of computer programming.</p>
                        <p>My interests are working out, equities market, reading books to learn, finance, and exotic cars.</p>
